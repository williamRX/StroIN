# Weapons

`Weapons` is a subclass of `Items` that represents weapons in the game. It's initialized with a name, damage value, and a boolean indicating if it's a melee weapon. The `getDamage` method returns the damage value. The `isMelee` method returns the `isMelee` flag. The `getSprite` method returns the weapon's texture.
