# Level0

`Level0` is a class that implements the `Level` interface and represents the first level in the game. It's initialized with a `StroIN` game instance, a `Player` object, and a list of `Platform` objects. The `create` methods initialize the level, with the second one taking a `Player` object for levels where the player is already defined. The `render` method is responsible for drawing the level on the screen. The `dispose` method is used to clean up resources when the level is no longer needed. The `passGame` method is used to pass the `StroIN` game instance to the level.
